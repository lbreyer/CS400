Once upon a time in a land far far away, there were two frogs, Rob and Bob Frog. They lived together in this pond and thought 
long about the world beyond the pond of Rob and Bob. For beyond the pond of Rob and Bob did mountains rise above the purple fog? 
Did fearsome beasts run through the bog? Were there deserts vast and rivers long? What wonders lie beyond the pond of Rob and Bob? 
One day Rob and Bob decided they wanted to explore the land beyond the pond. So they worked, oh they worked, hard and long to build 
themselves a raft made out of logs. They hopped aboard, and as the current picked up they began to float along. Before long they 
had left behind the pod of Rob and Bob. As they travelled the days were hot and the nights were long, but they kept their spirts 
as they sang their song. Their melodies floated through twists and turns, through rises and falls. What advetures awaited the frogs, 
Rob and Bob? (Written by Luke Breyer)
